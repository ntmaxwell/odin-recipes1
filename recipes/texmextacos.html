    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A delicious deep dish pizza. You can add whatever toppings you want.
        I like to keep it simple. You don't want to add too many toppingsthat are high in water content.
        Too much water in the recipe can make the pizza dough soggy.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Pizza Dough (make your own)</li>
        <li>Bell Pepper</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
        <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>Mushroom</li>
        <li>Mozzarella</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Add a good amount of oil to the cast iron. 3 TBSP or so</li>
        <li>Put your dough in the pan. Use your fingers to even it out. Make a 
            lip around the edges.
        </li>
        <li>Shred your Mozzarella</li>
        <li>Add your mozzarella to the dough on the bottom. Smash it down. Use it to help
            keep the shape of the dough.
        </li>
        <li>Slice your veggies. Top the pizza with them. Add pepperonis if you'd like</li>
        <li>Add your sauce on top. The sauce goes on top. Cheese goes on bottom.</li>
    </ol>
