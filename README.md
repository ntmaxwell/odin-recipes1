This is my second time doing this project. So I have some new goals.
I hope to re-learn what I had learned the first time.
I'm hoping I can do it faster this time, maybe more accurately.
I want to write better commits this time. I'm not sure they were bad the first time,
but I want to focus on writing good commits when necessary.


I'll hopefully have a website with links to a few recipes. Those recipe
pages will have pictures. Different headers. ETC.
